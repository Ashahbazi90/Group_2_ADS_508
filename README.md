# Final Team Project MSADS_508 Cloud Computing Group 2

## Green Drive Solutions (GDS) impact on electric vehicle industry
GreenDrive Solutions is committed to enhancing the infrastructure for electric vehicles by strategically placing charging stations. This project leverages comprehensive data analysis and advanced machine-learning techniques to pinpoint optimal locations for these facilities, ensuring they meet the increasing demands of electric vehicle owners. By analyzing current electric vehicle registration trends, population data, and existing charging infrastructure, the project aims to improve user experience and accessibility, thus fostering the adoption of electric vehicles in alignment with environmental sustainability goals.

### Goals

- **Strategic Charging Station Placement:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze electric vehicle population data and registration activity to identify the most effective locations for new EV charging stations.

- **Demand Forecasting and Capacity Planning:** Implement predictive models to project future demands for EV charging, allowing for timely and strategic expansion of the charging infrastructure.

- **User Experience Enhancement:** Through data analysis and modeling, optimize the placement and availability of EV charging stations to reduce wait times and improve overall service quality, thereby aligning with GreenDrive Solutions' commitment to customer satisfaction.

### Non-Goals

- **Charging Technology Development:** The project will not engage in developing new charging technologies but will focus on optimizing the use of existing technologies.

- **Nationwide Expansion:** The initial phase does not include a nationwide or international expansion but concentrates on areas with high demand and adoption rates.

- **Comprehensive Alternative Fuel Solutions:** This initiative targets explicitly electric vehicles and does not encompass charging solutions for hybrids or other alternative fuel vehicles.
